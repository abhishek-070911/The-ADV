Project--
  Autonomous Vehicle Collision Avoidance Analysis


Problem Statement--

  Autonomous vehicles must rapidly detect obstacles and initiate braking to avoid collisions. This project analyzes collision scenarios to identify high-risk object and speed combinations             where braking is triggered but avoidance fails.


Dataset--

  * 10,000 simulated collision scenarios

  * Object type, speed, time-to-collision

  * Braking and collision avoidance outcomes


Tools--

  * SQL (risk aggregation, failure analysis, ranking)

  * Python (dataset generation)

  * Power BI (KPI tracking and visualization)


Key Metrics--

  * Collision Avoidance Rate (%)

  * Braking Success Rate (%)

  * High-Risk Scenario Percentage (TTC < 2s)

  * Failed Braking Cases


Key Insights--

  * Motorcycles at medium speeds showed the highest braking failure rates
    
  * Very high-speed car collisions reflected expected physical limitations.

  * Risk was driven more by failure rate than scenario volume.

Outcome--

  The analysis enables prioritization of high-risk scenarios for safety system improvement and monitoring.
